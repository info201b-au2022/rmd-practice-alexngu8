## Covid Report
I write a paragraph here. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is 17506662. And, the total number of US deaths is 313820. 

(**Note**: Why are there no commas in the *total number of US deaths* ? Can you change `analysis.R` file so that the number is commented with commas?)

I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
